Touchpoints,#2393CF,I don’t trust the reviews on the company’s website. I’m going to do my own research to validate whether this thing is legit.,The survey is displayed on the website to preview all the questions before committing to signing up for a trip,,Tell all our friends about this crazy cool thing we are trying,"Since we were travelling over halloween, they mentioned providing some fun ways to celebrate in costume in our mystery city","If you try to peek through the back of the envelope, you can see a page that says ‘No Peeking’. Clever people!",The information is printed on cardstock. They also created a Google map with all the recommended restaurants and attractions.,We had the same travel concierge from start to finish. Thank you!
Process Ownership,#3A81BA,"Create a hashtag or public forum for anyone to contribute their thoughts, good, bad or otherwise",,The order summary which included my survey responses was hard to read and verify what I had submitted,,"Pain point: The airport was a 3 hr drive away and since the flight was leaving very early, we got a hotel near the airport.",,We were hoping to get some of the local faves in terms of restaurants and bars. Could be an opportunity to highlight previous traveller or local recommendations.,
